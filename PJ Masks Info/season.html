In France, it premiered on December 12, 2015.<br><br>The first season focuses on the premise's basic features of the show before moving on to the advanced features after this season; these features include: having the show to majorly focus on Tarabiscoville than the show's other newer discovered locations, almost every episode (except for "Gekko Saves Christmas") beginning and ending in the day, showcasing what main motives and personalities the three primary villains have before moving on to their minor motives and moving away from their focus of their traits and all of the episode titles have a hero's name, instead of keeping it omitted or having a villain's name in the episode title.<br><br>Season 1's focus is mainly about the introduction of the PJ Masks and their motive on stopping the villains from causing any trouble. It should be noted on a meeting with Christian De Vita, he confirmed that a villain named Firefly was intended to appear in this season. But she was scrapped until the producers find a possible use for her later in the series.</p>

<h4>Trivia</h4>
<ul>
<li>This episode, along with "Blame it on the Train, Owlette," marks the Season 1 premiere and is the first episode of the book's television adaptation. Said episodes are also the first episodes to air in 2015.
This episode features Luna Girl's first appearance.</li>
<li>She also appears to show her strongest portrayal of anger than the rest of the series (except for "Luna's Cosmic Tantrum"), screaming multiple times due to Owlette and Gekko helping Catboy to evade chase from the clouds summoned by Luna Girl.</li>
<li>This encouraged Romuald Racioppo to create a book adaptation of the episode by reusing elements and storyline in the episode to create "La Legende des Pyjamasques," while it explores on the backstory of the book counterparts of the onscreen characters and incorporates Luna's temper tantrums to create Sorceline's all-angry personality.</li>
<li>This episode also features the moths' and Alley Cat first appearance.</li>
<li>In this episode, Luna Girl does a tango with Catboy while fighting over the Luna Magnet. It is uncertain if this was on purpose or not.</li>
<li>This episode reveals that Catboy is afraid of water, referencing a stereotype of cats.</li>
<li>This is the first episode of Season 1 that focuses on Catboy.</li>
<li>When Catboy realizes his mistake and finds out how much the other PJs need him, he can be heard saying, "I hate getting wet, but not as much as I hate letting my friends down." This is the first use of the word "hate" in PJ Masks, which could be suggestive/inappropriate for some viewers.</li>
<li>Many of the elements and storyline in the episode are reused and inspired to create "La Légende des Pyjamasques" for the backstory for Les Pyjamasques.</li>

<ul>
<li>During the Narrator's introduction sequence, Gekko's voice was cleverly muted due to it being stolen by Romeo.</li>
<li>This is the first time Romeo gets zapped by his own inventions.</li>
<li>The episode also shows the strongest portrayal of Romeo's smug attitude on trying to look great on everything with compliments from other people. This encouraged Romuald Racioppo to create a book adaptation of the episode by reusing elements and storyline in the episode to create Les Pyjamasques et l'opération zéro for the introduction of Roméo's new motive based on his television counterpart's compliments and Greg's hatred for reciting poetry.</li>
<li>This is one of the first episodes that aired on Disney XD during the January 2022 season.</li>
<li>In two scenes, Romeo is seen without any legs. These two scenes can be seen in the gallery page for this episode.</li>
<li>In the transformation sequence, as Gekko's voice was muted due to Romeo stealing it, Lionel's gurgling noise is muted by mistake. And this error would remain in later episodes starting with the next episode (except for "Gekko Saves Christmas") until the premiere of Season 2.</li>
<li>However, this error was fixed with a French voice actor voicing Lionel in the French version of the show. Despite Gekko's voice being muted in the transformation sequence, his voice in the transformation sequence was unmuted in the French dub.</li>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Catboy VS. Robo-Cat</button>
<div class="content1">
<p>By day, Connor, Greg, and Amaya were playing frisbee, but Connor's frisbee went into his garden. So once he got it, Greg and Amaya disappeared. By night, Catboy goes out to search for his friends, and thinks that they are being controlled by Romeo. He then discovers they are robot clones who Romeo calls "Robo-Owl" and "Robo-Gekko," while the real Greg and Amaya are being locked in hanging cages. They tried to get Catboy to get them out, but he is overprotective and claims that they don't stand a chance without their superpowers. The robots have all the powers of the originals, plus the added ability of firing energy beams out of their eyes. Robo-Gekko manages to steal the Cat-Car away from Catboy. Meanwhile, Greg borrows Amaya's pink wing hairpins, and uses it to remove the screws holding the cage together. Catboy tries to figure out how to get the pajamas back, which are necessary for accessing the PJ Mask powers. We do not know why the PJ's are required for the PJ Masks to activate their powers. Romeo does not explain how he got the pajamas, but this indicates that he is aware of their civilian identities, and home locations. He mentions he spent 2 years building a Super Computer to power the robots, but it is not clear if he has been battling the PJ Masks for that long or if he began building the computer for a different reason.</p>
<h4>Characters</h4>

<li>Robo-Cat</li>
<li>Robo-Gekko</li>

<li>Ruffles</li>
</ul>
<h4>Moral</h4>
<ul>
<li>Don't judge a book by its cover.</li>
<li>Don't be overprotective (work with others).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Trivia</h4>
<ul>
<li>In this episode, Romeo introduces Robo-Cat, Robo-Owl, and Robo-Gekko, powered by the Super Computer.</li>
<li>This is the first time that only one member of the PJ Masks headed to HQ.</li>
<li>This episode reveals that Romeo knew the PJ Masks' real identities and names the whole time.</li>
<li>Romeo says that Catboy wouldn't be able to tell the robots apart from the real PJ Masks. However, he most likely would, because the robots act more robotic, and have mechanized voices. This still somehow fools Catboy, though.</li>
<li>In this episode, an alternate version of the transformation sequence lyrics can be heard. However, in the French dub, this isn't included and kept the French-language lyrics of the transformation sequence. This is the first time Lionel doesn't appear in the transformation sequence. The transformation sequence also edits out Owlette and Gekko from being seen in the sequence. However, their parts of the sequence are featured near the end of the episode.</li>
<li>This is the first episode with the word "Vs." in the title.</li>
<li>Romeo capturing Connor's friends while he was a short distance away from them off-screen is similar to Shadow Moth using Sentibubbler to capture Rena Rouge's civilian form's friends and family off-screen while she was a short distance away from them in the Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir episode "Sentibubbler."</li>
